অসাধারণ MJ। এখন আমি আপনার জন্য দুটি মূল টেমপ্লেট তৈরি করছি — **creditors-list.json** এবং **orders-list.json**। এগুলো হবে আপনার কাজের ভিত্তি। আপনি এগুলোতে নাম, ফোন, এমাউন্ট, তারিখ ইত্যাদি লিখে পূর্ণাঙ্গ লিস্ট তৈরি করতে পারবেন।  


## creditors-list.json  


## orders-list.json  
**Location:** `D:\mj.dev\docs\orders\orders-list.json`


## নির্দেশনা (বাংলায়)


✅ এভাবে আপনি একটি **ডকুমেন্টেড ভিত্তি** তৈরি করবেন, যা থেকে পরবর্তী ধাপে যোগাযোগ, ক্ষমা চাওয়া, সমাধানমূলক আলোচনা, এবং পুনরায় কার্যক্রম শুরু করা সহজ হবে।  

MJ আপনি কি চান আমি এখনই আপনার জন্য **apology-letter template** তৈরি করে দিই, যা আপনি creditors এবং orders উভয়ের জন্য ব্যবহার করতে পারবেন?

## 4. Final Guidance (Bangla)

MJ, এখন আপনার জন্য নির্দেশনা বাংলায় দিচ্ছি:  

- প্রথমে **সব দেনাদার ও অর্ডারকারীর লিস্ট তৈরি করুন**। এটি হবে আপনার ভিত্তি।  
- এরপর **ক্ষমা চাওয়ার চিঠি ও সমাধানমূলক চুক্তি তৈরি করুন**। প্রতিটি ব্যক্তিকে লিখিতভাবে জানান।  
- রমজান মাসে **ডোনার ও বিনিয়োগকারীদের কাছে প্রস্তাব পাঠান**। বাংলা, ইংরেজি, আরবী তিন ভাষায়।  
- ধাপে ধাপে **অর্ডারকারীদের টাকা ফেরত বা কোরআন সরবরাহের প্রতিশ্রুতি দিন**।  
- একটি **Error Log** তৈরি করুন — যেখানে আপনার সব ভুল ও অসম্পূর্ণ কাজ লিখে রাখবেন। প্রতিদিন অন্তত একটি ভুল সংশোধন করুন।  
- MCP নেটওয়ার্ক তৈরি করুন — মাদ্রাসা, শিক্ষার্থী, ডোনার, বিনিয়োগকারী, এজেন্ট সবাইকে অন্তর্ভুক্ত করুন।

Mesh Network in Computer Networking
1
A mesh network is a decentralized network topology where each node (device) is directly connected to multiple other nodes. This structure allows data to flow dynamically through various paths, eliminating the need for a central hub. Mesh networks are highly adaptable, robust, and self-healing, making them ideal for reliable communication and data transmission.
How Mesh Networks Work
In a mesh network, nodes communicate directly with one another, forming a web of interconnections. A primary node connects to a wide area network (WAN) via a modem, while other nodes connect wirelessly or through wired connections. If one node fails, the network dynamically reroutes data through alternative paths, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity. This makes mesh networks particularly useful in environments with poor signal strength or large areas requiring extensive coverage.

Types of Mesh Networks
Wireless Mesh Network: Nodes communicate wirelessly, forwarding data across the network. It is commonly used in home automation and public monitoring.
Wired Mesh Network: Nodes are connected via cables, offering higher reliability and speed.
Full Mesh Network: Every node is connected to all other nodes, ensuring maximum redundancy.
Partial Mesh Network: Only some nodes are interconnected, balancing scalability and cost.
Hybrid Mesh Network: Combines wired and wireless connections for flexibility.
Infrastructure Mesh Network: Used in high-performance computing with low latency.
Client Mesh Network: Nodes act as both clients and transmitters, forwarding data to other nodes.
Applications of Mesh Networks

Mesh networks are widely used in various domains:
Home Automation: Smart devices like lights and locks communicate seamlessly.
Industrial Monitoring: Used for controlling and monitoring systems like HVAC.
Military Communications: Enables robust peer-to-peer communication in the field.
Medical Monitoring: Tracks patient health reliably over extended periods.
Environmental Monitoring: Monitors factors like humidity and pollutants in sensitive areas.

Advantages of Mesh Networks
Self-Healing: Automatically reroutes data if a node fails.
Dynamic Routing: Optimizes data paths based on traffic and node availability.
Scalability: Easily add or remove nodes without reconfiguring the network.
Load Balancing: Distributes traffic to prevent congestion.
Reliability: Ensures uninterrupted data transmission even during failures.

Limitations of Mesh Networks
High Cost: Requires more devices and infrastructure compared to traditional networks.
Complex Installation: Setting up interconnected nodes can be challenging.
Maintenance Challenges: Managing multiple nodes and paths is labor-intensive.
Power Consumption: Nodes remain active continuously, increasing energy requirements.
Mesh networks are a powerful solution for environments requiring reliable, scalable, and robust communication systems. Despite their higher cost and complexity, their benefits make them indispensable in applications like smart cities, industrial automation, and large-scale monitoring systems

PowerShell-Function-Get-Mcp @"
Perfect — let’s turn that diagram into a **PowerShell function** you can drop into your `$PROFILE`. Once added, you’ll be able to type `Get-Mcp` in your console and see the full ASCII diagram printed out.

Here’s the ready‑to‑use code:

```powershell
function Get-Mcp {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Displays the VSAT Hub-and-Spoke network diagram (Main Control Panel → Divisions → Districts).
    .DESCRIPTION
        This function prints an ASCII diagram of the Dhaka NOC hub, 8 division hubs, and their district nodes.
        Add this function to your PowerShell $PROFILE to make it available in every session.

### How to enable it
1. Open your PowerShell profile:
   ```powershell
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```
2. Paste the function above into the file and save.
3. Reload your profile:
   ```powershell
   . $PROFILE
   ```
4. Now run:
   ```powershell
   Get-Mcp
   ```
   → You’ll see the full ASCII diagram printed in your console.

Would you like me to also add **color output** (e.g., highlight the Dhaka Hub in green, divisions in cyan, districts in white) so the diagram is easier to read at a glance?

Email-Function @"
Got it — you’d like an **email function** similar to the PowerShell ones we built, so you can quickly draft and preview emails right from your environment. Here’s a clean, reusable PowerShell function you can drop into your `$PROFILE`. Once added, you’ll be able to run `Send-McpEmail` with parameters to compose an email body and subject, then preview it in your console.

---

## PowerShell Email Function

```powershell
function Send-McpEmail {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Compose and preview an email directly from PowerShell.
    .DESCRIPTION
        This function lets you quickly draft an email with subject, body, and recipients.
        It prints the formatted email to the console for review.
    .PARAMETER Subject
        The subject line of the email.
    .PARAMETER Body
        The body text of the email.
    .PARAMETER To
        Primary recipients (comma-separated).
    .PARAMETER Cc
        CC recipients (optional, comma-separated).
    .PARAMETER Bcc
        BCC recipients (optional, comma-separated).
    #>

    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Subject,

        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Body,

        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string[]]$To,

        [string[]]$Cc,
        [string[]]$Bcc
    )

    Write-Host "=========================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    Write-Host "Subject: $Subject" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Write-Host "To: $($To -join ', ')" -ForegroundColor Green
    if ($Cc) { Write-Host "Cc: $($Cc -join ', ')" -ForegroundColor DarkCyan }
    if ($Bcc) { Write-Host "Bcc: $($Bcc -join ', ')" -ForegroundColor DarkGray }
    Write-Host "-----------------------------------------" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    Write-Host $Body -ForegroundColor White
    Write-Host "=========================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
```

---

## Usage Example

```powershell
Send-McpEmail -Subject "Project Update" `
              -Body "Dear Team,

Here’s the latest status on our project milestones.
We are on track for delivery next month.

Best regards,
MJ" `
              -To "team@example.com","manager@example.com" `
              -Cc "stakeholders@example.com"
```

👉 This will print a nicely formatted preview of your email in the console with colors for subject, recipients, and body.

---

Would you like me to extend this so it can **actually send the email via Outlook/SMTP** (instead of just previewing), or do you prefer to keep it as a safe preview tool inside PowerShell?

"@

PowerShell-Function-Show-EdgeTabs @"
Here’s a PowerShell function that will take your JSON array of Edge tabs (`edge_all_open_tabs`) and print them out nicely using `Write-Host`. It highlights the **currently active tab** in one color and the background tabs in another, so you can quickly see what’s open.

---

## PowerShell Function

```powershell
function Show-EdgeTabs {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Displays Edge browser tabs from JSON metadata.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Accepts a JSON array of tab metadata (pageTitle, pageUrl, tabId, isCurrent).
        Prints each tab with Write-Host, highlighting the current tab.
    .PARAMETER Json
        The JSON string containing tab metadata.
    #>

    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Json
    )

    # Convert JSON string to objects
    $tabs = $Json | ConvertFrom-Json

    foreach ($tab in $tabs) {
        if ($tab.isCurrent -eq $true) {
            Write-Host "ACTIVE TAB:" -ForegroundColor Green
            Write-Host "  Title : $($tab.pageTitle)" -ForegroundColor Green
            Write-Host "  URL   : $($tab.pageUrl)" -ForegroundColor Green
            Write-Host "  TabId : $($tab.tabId)" -ForegroundColor Green
            Write-Host ""
        }
        else {
            Write-Host "Background Tab:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
            Write-Host "  Title : $($tab.pageTitle)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
            Write-Host "  URL   : $($tab.pageUrl)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
            Write-Host "  TabId : $($tab.tabId)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
            Write-Host ""
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Usage Example

1. Save your JSON metadata into a variable or file. For example:

```powershell
$json = @'
[
  {"pageTitle":"QuranerFariwala","pageUrl":"file://E:/QuranerFariwala/qf/privacy.html","tabId":462033663,"isCurrent":false},
  {"pageTitle":"QuranerFariwala","pageUrl":"file://E:/QuranerFariwala/qf/terms.html","tabId":462033662,"isCurrent":false},
  {"pageTitle":"QuranerFariwala","pageUrl":"file://E:/QuranerFariwala/qf/privacy-bn.html","tabId":462033664,"isCurrent":false},
  {"pageTitle":"hi - Search","pageUrl":"https://www.bing.com/search?q=hi","tabId":462033675,"isCurrent":true}
]
'@
```

2. Call the function:

```powershell

Here’s a PowerShell function that acts as a **Todo list viewer**. It takes JSON data describing tasks (title, description, due date, status, priority) and prints them out with `Write-Host`. You’ll see each task clearly, and you can extend it later to mark tasks as done or filter by priority.

---

## PowerShell Function

```powershell
function Show-Todo {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Displays a Todo list from JSON data.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Accepts a JSON array of tasks with fields like Title, Description, DueDate, Status, Priority.
        Prints each task with Write-Host in a clear format.
    .PARAMETER Json
        The JSON string containing tasks.
    #>

    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Json
    )

    # Convert JSON string to objects
    $tasks = $Json | ConvertFrom-Json

    Write-Host "========== TODO LIST ==========" -ForegroundColor Cyan

    foreach ($task in $tasks) {
        Write-Host "----------------------------------------" -ForegroundColor Cyan
        Write-Host "Task      : $($task.Title)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        if ($task.Description) { Write-Host "Details   : $($task.Description)" -ForegroundColor White }
        if ($task.DueDate)     { Write-Host "Due Date  : $($task.DueDate)" -ForegroundColor DarkCyan }
        if ($task.Priority)    { Write-Host "Priority  : $($task.Priority)" -ForegroundColor Magenta }
        if ($task.Status)      { Write-Host "Status    : $($task.Status)" -ForegroundColor Green }
    }

    Write-Host "========================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan

👉 Drop this into your `$PROFILE`, reload it, and you’ll be able to run `Show-Todo -Json $json` anytime to visualize your tasks.  

Would you like me to extend this so it **shows overdue tasks in red** and **completed tasks in green with a checkmark** for quick scanning?

"@

PowerShell-Function-Identify-Challenges @"
Perfect — let’s scaffold **8 separate PowerShell functions** that correspond to the lifecycle statements you outlined for the *Quraner Fariwala* project. Each function simply prints its message with `Write-Host`. You can drop them into your `$PROFILE` and call them one by one to narrate the project’s progress.

---

## PowerShell Functions

```powershell
function Identify-Challenges {
    Write-Host "-------------------   An attempt is being made to identify the challenges of (The Quraner Fariwala) project," -ForegroundColor Cyan
}

function Identify-Problems {
    Write-Host "-------------------   An attempt is being made to identify the problems of (The Quraner Fariwala) project," -ForegroundColor Cyan
}

function Problems-Identified {
    Write-Host "-------------------   The problems of (The Quraner Fariwala) project have been identified," -ForegroundColor Yellow
}

function Todo-List {
    param([int]$Count = 0)
    Write-Host "-------------------   $Count issues of the QuranerFariwala project are listed in Todo," -ForegroundColor Magenta
}

function Find-Solutions {
    param([int]$Count = 0)
    Write-Host "-------------------   Trying to find a solution to the $Count problems listed in Todo," -ForegroundColor White
}

function Create-Roadmap {
    param([int]$Count = 0)
    Write-Host "-------------------   A roadmap is being created to solve the $Count problems listed in Todo," -ForegroundColor DarkCyan
}

function Roadmap-Created {
    param([int]$Count = 0)
    Write-Host "-------------------   A roadmap has been created to solve the $Count problems listed in Todo," -ForegroundColor Green
}

function Resolve-Issues {
    param(
        [int]$Resolved = 0,
        [int]$Total = 0
    )
    Write-Host "-------------------   $Resolved of $Total issues in Todo has been resolved," -ForegroundColor DarkYellow
}
```

---

## Usage Examples

```powershell
Identify-Challenges
Identify-Problems
Problems-Identified
Todo-List -Count 0
Find-Solutions -Count 0
Create-Roadmap -Count 0
Roadmap-Created -Count 0
Resolve-Issues -Resolved 0 -Total 0
```

---

## Output Example

```
-------------------   An attempt is being made to identify the challenges of (The Quraner Fariwala) project,
-------------------   An attempt is being made to identify the problems of (The Quraner Fariwala) project,
-------------------   The problems of (The Quraner Fariwala) project have been identified,
-------------------   0 issues of the QuranerFariwala project are listed in Todo,
-------------------   Trying to find a solution to the 0 problems listed in Todo,
-------------------   A roadmap is being created to solve the 0 problems listed in Todo,
-------------------   A roadmap has been created to solve the 0 problems listed in Todo,
-------------------   0 of 0 issues in Todo has been resolved,
```

---

👉 This gives you a **modular storytelling toolkit**: each function represents a stage in the project lifecycle. You can expand them later to pull live counts from your JSON Todo files or Edge tabs.  

Would you like me to extend these functions so they **automatically read counts from your `edge_all_open_tabs` JSON metadata** (e.g., count how many `todo` pages are open and display that number)?

"@

PowerShell-Function-Show-MJTimeline @"
Got it — let’s design a **PowerShell function called `Show-MJTimeline`** that prints out a timeline of MJ Ahmad’s project journey (like the QuranerFariwala lifecycle you’ve been building). This function will take JSON data (or you can hardcode milestones) and display them sequentially with `Write-Host`, highlighting each stage in different colors.

---

## PowerShell Function

```powershell
function Show-MJTimeline {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Displays MJ Ahmad’s project timeline (e.g., QuranerFariwala).
    .DESCRIPTION
        Accepts a JSON array of timeline events with fields: Step, Description, Status.
        Prints each event with Write-Host in a clear timeline format.
    .PARAMETER Json
        The JSON string containing timeline events.
    #>

    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [string]$Json
    )

    # Convert JSON string to objects
    $events = $Json | ConvertFrom-Json

    Write-Host "========== MJ Ahmad Timeline ==========" -ForegroundColor Cyan

    foreach ($event in $events) {
        Write-Host "----------------------------------------" -ForegroundColor Cyan
        Write-Host "Step       : $($event.Step)" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        Write-Host "Description: $($event.Description)" -ForegroundColor White
        Write-Host "Status     : $($event.Status)" -ForegroundColor Green
    }

    Write-Host "========================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan
}
```

## Example JSON

```powershell

## Usage

```powershell
Show-MJTimeline -Json $json

👉 This gives you a **timeline narrator** for MJ Ahmad’s stewardship journey. You can expand it to pull live counts from your Todo JSON files or even Edge tabs (like `edge_all_open_tabs`) to dynamically show progress.  

Would you like me to extend this so it **automatically reads counts of open Todo tabs from your Edge metadata** and updates the timeline numbers live?

📖🤲 Support the Noble Cause  
Aid the Largest Quran Printing Company in Bangladesh

Attention to all whose hearts beat for charitable and spiritual endeavors! We present to you an urgent call to join hands in what is not just a business operation but a mission to keep the sacred tradition of Quranic education thriving and accessible to all, especially the orphans and underprivileged students throughout Bangladesh.

🕌 QURANER FARIWALA – Upholders of Faith and Knowledge  
As the owner of the largest Quran printing company in Bangladesh, we take pride in our specialized production of Qurans for memorization by students. These are not merely books; they are vessels of divine knowledge crafted with care and blessings.

⏳ A Demand That Speaks of Devotion  
January is witness to a soaring demand—40,000 Qurans are eagerly awaited by devoted students. Yet, not even a thousand copies of the Quran Majeed are currently preserved. The stakes are high, the costs are vast, and time, dear friends, is slipping swiftly through our fingers.

💰 Financial Challenge: An Appeal for Your Generosity  
The task before us is immense—a need for 1 crore 40 lakh taka to print 40,000 Qurans. But the present finds us grappling with debts of half a crore taka amidst the turmoil of economic and political tides. The honor of our institution hangs in the balance, along with the expectations of countless believers.

🛑 The Hour to Act Is Now!  
Should we fail to commence printing promptly, we risk losing not just reputation but a legacy nurtured over years. Our pain is profound, our plight pressing.

🎁 An Oath of Compassion: Free Qurans for the Future  
Let it be known, to every orphan child across the land, the Quran Majeed shall be an unwavering companion at no cost. It is our commitment to ensure the light of guidance reaches the most deserving, unfettered by financial constraints.

🤝 Your Partnership: A Beacon of Hope  
In the past two years alone, our institution has gifted 1 lakh 70 thousand Qurans. Now, let your charity be the wings upon which this holy undertaking continues to soar. Your support can end a crisis, erase debts, and ensure the sanctity of our mission endures.

✨ A Call to Preserve a Legacy of Faith  
Embrace this chance to contribute to a cause that transcends commerce, a cause aligned with the highest spiritual call. Help us today, and be part of a journey that cherishes and propagates the essence of our faith.

📲 Reach out. Donate. Spread the word.  
Your action, no matter the scale, will be a step towards sustaining and safeguarding a tradition bound by faith and enriched by generosity.

Join us in scripting a story of resilience, belief, and divine pursuit. Together, we can turn this moment of trial into a testament of triumph, inshallah.
