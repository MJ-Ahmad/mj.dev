NOTICE — mj.dev Ethical Stewardship Principles

mj.dev is not only a technical framework but also a declaration of values.  
Every artifact created under this project is governed by the following principles:

1. **Exclusion-Proof Design**  
   All scripts, documents, and workflows are architected to ensure no contributor or citizen is excluded.  
   Accessibility and clarity are non-negotiable.

2. **Inheritable Documentation**  
   Every file, README, and declaration is written to be passed on to future generations.  
   mj.dev is a living archive of stewardship, designed for continuity and legacy.

3. **Universal Accessibility**  
   UTF-8 safety, cross-platform compatibility, and responsive design are embedded in every artifact.  
   mj.dev belongs to everyone, everywhere.

4. **Accountability and Dignity**  
   Contributors are custodians of clarity and respect.  
   Every addition to mj.dev must uphold dignity, transparency, and traceable inheritance.

5. **Joyful Stewardship**  
   Branding, naming, and communication are designed to resonate with youth and citizens,  
   fostering pride, hope, and collective ownership.

This NOTICE is a reminder that mj.dev is more than code — it is a covenant of ethical architecture and human legacy.
